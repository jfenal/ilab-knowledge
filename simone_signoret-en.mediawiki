'''Simone Signoret''' ({{IPA-fr|simɔn siɲɔʁɛ|lang}}; born '''Simone Henriette Charlotte Kaminker'''; 25 March 1921 – 30 September 1985) was a  French actress. She received various accolades, including an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]], three [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Awards]], a [[César Award]], a [[Primetime Emmy Award]], and the [[Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress]], in addition to nominations for two [[Golden Globe Awards]].

== Early life ==
Signoret was born Simone Henriette Charlotte Kaminker in [[Wiesbaden]], Germany, to Georgette (née Signoret) and André Kaminker. She was the eldest of three children, with two younger brothers. Her father, a pioneering interpreter who worked in the [[League of Nations]], was a French-born army officer from an assimilated and middle-class Polish-Jewish and Hungarian-Jewish family,<ref>{{cite book | last = Signoret | first = Simone | title = Nostalgia isn't what it used to be | publisher = Penguin Books | location = Harmondsworth, England New York | year = 1979 | isbn = 978-0-14-005181-0 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/nostalgiaisntwha00sign }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = Nostalgia Isn't What It Used to Be (Paperback) | work = The Guardian | date = 7 August 2000 | quote = Signoret was descended from Polish/Hungarian Jews }}</ref> who brought the family to [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]] on the outskirts of Paris. Her mother, Georgette, from whom she acquired her stage name, was a French Catholic.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Hayward | first = Susan | title = Simone Signoret (1921–1985) — The body political | journal = Women's Studies International Forum | volume = 23 | issue = 6 | pages = 739–747 | doi = 10.1016/S0277-5395(00)00147-3 | date = November–December 2000 }}</ref>

Signoret grew up in Paris in an intellectual atmosphere and studied English, German and Latin. After completing secondary school during the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|Nazi occupation]], Simone was responsible for supporting her family and forced to take work as a typist for a French collaborationist newspaper ''Les nouveaux temps'', run by [[Jean Luchaire]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Garden of Dreams: The Life of Simone Signoret|last = DeMaio|first = Patricia A.|publisher = University Press of Mississippi|date = January 2014}}</ref>

== Career ==
During the occupation of France, Signoret mixed with an artistic group of writers and actors who met at the [[Café de Flore]] in the [[Saint-Germain-des-Prés]] quarter. By this time, she had developed an interest in acting and was encouraged by her friends, including her lover [[Daniel Gélin]] to follow her ambition. In 1942, she began appearing in bit parts and was able to earn enough money to support her mother and two brothers as her father, who was a French patriot, had fled the country in 1940 to join General [[Charles de Gaulle|De Gaulle]] in England. She took her mother's maiden name for the screen to help hide her Jewish roots.

Signoret's sensual features and earthy nature led to type-casting and she was often seen in roles as a prostitute. She won considerable attention in ''[[La Ronde (1950 film)|La Ronde]]'' (1950), a film which was banned briefly in New York City as immoral. She won further acclaim, including an acting award from the British Film Academy, for her portrayal of another prostitute in [[Jacques Becker]]'s ''[[Casque d'or]]'' (1951). She appeared in many French films during the 1950s, including ''[[Thérèse Raquin (1953 film)|Thérèse Raquin]]'' (1953), directed by [[Marcel Carné]], ''[[Les Diaboliques (film)|Les Diaboliques]]'' (1954), and ''[[The Crucible (1957 film)|The Crucible]]'' (''Les Sorcières de Salem''; 1956), based on [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''[[The Crucible]]''.
[[File:Room at the Top screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Simone Signoret with [[Laurence Harvey]] in ''[[Room at the Top (1959 film)|Room at the Top]]''; the film established her as an international actress.]]

In 1958, Signoret acted in the English independent film ''[[Room at the Top (1959 film)|Room at the Top]]'' (1959), and her performance won numerous awards, including the [[Prix d'interprétation féminine|Best Female Performance Prize]] at [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] and the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. She was offered films in Hollywood, but turned them down for several years, continuing to work in France and England—for example, with [[Laurence Olivier]] in ''[[Term of Trial]]'' (1962). She earned another Oscar nomination for her work on ''[[Ship of Fools (film)|Ship of Fools]]'' (1965), appeared in a few other Hollywood films, and returned to France in 1969.

In 1962, Signoret translated Lillian Hellman's play ''[[The Little Foxes]]'' into French for a production in Paris that ran for six months at the Theatre Sarah-Bernhardt. She played the Regina role as well. Hellman was displeased with the production, although the translation was approved by scholars selected by Hellman.<ref>Signoret 1978, pp. 324–328.</ref>

Signoret's one attempt at Shakespeare, performing [[Macbeth|Lady Macbeth]] with [[Alec Guinness]] at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] in London in 1966 proved to be ill-advised, with some harsh critics; one referred to her English as "impossibly Gallic".<ref>Sutcliffe, Tom. [http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Guardian/0,4029,351452,00.html "Sir Alec Guinness".] ''Film Guardian'', 7 August 2000.</ref>

Signoret won acclaim for her portrayal of a weary madam in ''[[Madame Rosa]]'' (1977) and as an unmarried sister who unknowingly falls in love with her paralyzed brother via anonymous correspondence in ''{{Interlanguage link|Chère inconnue|fr|3=Chère inconnue|lt=I Sent a Letter to my Love}}'' (1980). She continued to appear in many movies before her death in 1985.

== Personal life ==
Signoret's memoirs ''Nostalgia Isn't What It Used to Be'', were published in 1978. She also wrote the novel ''Adieu Volodya'', published in 1985, the year of her death.

Signoret first married filmmaker [[Yves Allégret]] (1944–1949), with whom she had a daughter [[Catherine Allégret]]. Her second marriage was to the Italian-born French actor [[Yves Montand]] in 1951, a union which lasted until her death; the couple had no children.

Signoret died of pancreatic cancer in [[Autheuil-Authouillet]], France, aged 64. She was buried in [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris, and Yves Montand later was buried next to her.

Signoret identified as Jewish. She was a supporter of a variety of Jewish causes, including the [[Zionism|Zionist]] movement and the [[Soviet Jewry movement]]. She maintained relationships with many Israeli leaders and was critical of antisemitism in the [[French Communist Party]]. Because she was of [[Who is a Jew?|patrilineal]] Jewish ancestry and was therefore not considered Jewish under traditional [[halakha]], there was no religious ceremony at her funeral.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jta.org/archive/simone-signoret-dead-at-64 |title=Simone Signoret Dead at 64 |publisher=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] |accessdate=2024-04-29}}</ref>
