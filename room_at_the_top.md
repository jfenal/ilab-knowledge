***Room at the Top*** is a 1959 [British](United_Kingdom "wikilink")
[drama](Drama_(film_and_television) "wikilink") film based on the 1957
[novel of the same name](Room_at_the_Top_(novel) "wikilink") by [John
Braine](John_Braine "wikilink"). It was adapted by [Neil
Paterson](Neil_Paterson_(writer) "wikilink") (with uncredited work by
[Mordecai Richler](Mordecai_Richler "wikilink")), directed by [Jack
Clayton](Jack_Clayton "wikilink") (his feature-length debut), and
produced by [John and James Woolf](John_and_James_Woolf "wikilink"). The
film stars [Laurence Harvey](Laurence_Harvey "wikilink"), [Simone
Signoret](Simone_Signoret "wikilink"), [Heather
Sears](Heather_Sears "wikilink"), [Donald
Wolfit](Donald_Wolfit "wikilink"), [Donald
Houston](Donald_Houston "wikilink"), and [Hermione
Baddeley](Hermione_Baddeley "wikilink").

The film was widely lauded, and it was nominated for six [Academy
Awards](Academy_Awards "wikilink"), winning two: [Best
Actress](Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress "wikilink") (Signoret) and [Best
Adapted
Screenplay](Academy_Award_for_Best_Adapted_Screenplay "wikilink")
(Paterson). Its other nominations at the [32nd Academy
Awards](32nd_Academy_Awards "wikilink") were for [Best
Picture](Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture "wikilink"), [Best
Director](Academy_Award_for_Best_Director "wikilink") (Clayton), [Best
Actor](Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor "wikilink") (Harvey), and [Best
Supporting
Actress](Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actress "wikilink")
(Baddeley).[^1] Baddeley\'s performance, consisting of 2 minutes and 19
seconds of screen time, is the shortest ever to be nominated for an
acting Oscar.[^2]

## Plot

Soon after the Second World War, in the [West Riding of
Yorkshire](West_Riding_of_Yorkshire "wikilink"), England, Joseph (Joe)
Lampton, an ambitious young man, moves from his hometown, the dreary
factory town of Dufton, to the somewhat larger town of Warnley to assume
a secure but poorly paid and dead-end post in the Borough Treasurer\'s
Department. Determined to get ahead, and ignoring the warnings of his
colleague and flatmate Charlie Soames, he pursues Susan Brown, the
daughter of a local industrial magnate. She has been dating wealthy Jack
Wales but Joe is able to charm her. Mr and Mrs Brown attempt to
frustrate Joe\'s social climbing by persuading Joe\'s boss to encourage
him to pursue a woman of his own class; getting him a job offer back in
Dufton, which he refuses when he discovers the machination; and sending
Susan on a trip abroad, but Susan remains smitten.

While pursuing Susan, Joe continues to see Alice Aisgill, an unhappily
married Frenchwoman ten years his senior who came to England as a
teacher a decade earlier and married George Aisgill, a haughty and
abusive upper-middle class Englishman who is now having numerous
affairs. Joe thinks he is just killing time with Alice and Alice says
they can just be \"loving friends\". Their feelings for each other begin
to turn into something more and Joe starts to lose interest in his
pursuit of Susan. The relationship is passionate, tempestuous and after
a particularly heated argument, Joe switches his focus back to Susan. He
manages to take her virginity but is unsatisfied and finds himself drawn
back to Alice.

Joe and Alice go away on a short holiday and Alice is overjoyed that Joe
seems to have decided to end his quest for wealth and social status in
favour of simply being happy with himself and with her. They decide she
will ask for a divorce when she gets home but when she does, George
refuses and declares he will ruin Joe and Alice, both socially and
financially, if their relationship continues. While Joe is brooding over
this, Mr Brown delivers the news that Susan is pregnant and that he
expects Joe to stop seeing Alice and marry Susan, in which case Joe can
come to work for him at a generous salary.

Seeing no way around his obstacles to a relationship with Alice, Joe
tells her that he is going to marry Susan. Heartbroken, Alice gets drunk
in a pub and the next morning, while his co-workers are celebrating his
engagement, Joe hears that she drove her car off a cliff to which she
and he used to go together and died slowly over the course of several
hours. Devastated, Joe leaves the office and wanders to the flat where
he and Alice had their trysts but Alice\'s friend Elspeth, who owns the
flat, drives him away by screaming at him and blaming him for Alice\'s
death.

Joe goes to a pub on the waterfront, where a woman named Mavis comes on
to him because he is well-dressed. Although he is very drunk and does
not seem very interested in her (he calls her Alice), Joe keeps a man
from taking Mavis away against her will. When Joe is alone, the man and
some of his friends beat Joe unconscious. In the morning, Charlie finds
Joe lying in the street with a battered face but Joe\'s only concern is
his guilt over what he feels he led Alice to do.

A short time later, Joe and Susan get married. With a rich wife and
high-paying job, he has got everything he thought he wanted. As they are
driven away after the wedding, Susan\'s effusive praise of the ceremony
is cut short when she notices that there are tears in Joe\'s eyes, which
she misinterprets by saying \"I believe you really are sentimental after
all\".

## Adaptation

There are some differences between Braine\'s novel and the film. For
one, Joe\'s friend Charlie Soames is a friend from his hometown of
Dufton in the novel, whereas, in the film, he meets Charlie in Warnley
(which is called Warley in the book). Also, in the book, more is made of
Joe\'s lodging at the Thompsons\', which, in the novel, he arranged
before his arrival in Warley (in the film, Charlie arranges it soon
after they meet): it is through his association with the Thompsons that
Joe is able to gain entry to a higher social circle than that to which
he had previously had access, and Mrs Thompson\'s room is noted as being
at \"the top\" of Warley geographically, which serves as a metaphor for
Joe\'s social-climbing.

## Production

Producer James Woolf bought the film rights to
[Braine](John_Braine "wikilink")\'s novel, originally intending to cast
[Stewart Granger](Stewart_Granger "wikilink") as Joe and [Jean
Simmons](Jean_Simmons "wikilink") as Susan. [Vivien
Leigh](Vivien_Leigh "wikilink") was originally offered the part of
Alice.[^3] Woolf hired [Clayton](Jack_Clayton "wikilink") as director
after seeing *[The Bespoke
Overcoat](The_Bespoke_Overcoat "wikilink")*,[^4] an [Academy
Award-winning](29th_Academy_Awards "wikilink") short film that was
produced and distributed by companies founded by the [Woolf
brothers](John_and_James_Woolf "wikilink").

### Shooting

For the production, in addition to filming on sets at [Shepperton
Studios](Shepperton_Studios "wikilink") in [Surrey](Surrey "wikilink"),
there was extensive [location](filming_location "wikilink")-shooting in
[Halifax](Halifax,_West_Yorkshire "wikilink"),
[Yorkshire](Yorkshire "wikilink"), which stood in for the fictional
towns of Warnley and Dufton. Greystones, a large mansion in the [Savile
Park](Savile_Park,_Halifax "wikilink") area of Halifax, was used as the
location for exterior scenes of the Brown family mansion; [Halifax
railway station](Halifax_railway_station_(England) "wikilink") doubled
as Warnley Station in the film; and [Halifax Town
Hall](Halifax_Town_Hall "wikilink") was used as the Warnley Town Hall.
The wedding was filmed at All Souls church, Boothtown, Halifax. Some
scenes were also filmed in [Bradford](Bradford "wikilink"), notably the
one in which Joe travels on a bus and spots Susan in a lingerie shop and
those outside the amateur dramatics theatre.

Freddie Francis says John Woolf wanted to fire Francis during filming
but Clayton refused.[^5]

## Reception

The film was critically acclaimed.[^6] Reviewing the movie for [The New
York Times](The_New_York_Times "wikilink"), [Abraham
Weiler](A.H._Weiler "wikilink") praised Braine\'s novel, which he
compared favourably to [John Osborne](John_Osborne "wikilink")\'s *[Look
Back in Anger](Look_Back_in_Anger "wikilink")*, and noted the depth of
Harvey\'s, Signoret\'s, and Sears\'s portrayals, concluding that the
movie \"may be basically cheerless and somber, but it has a strikingly
effective view.\"[^7]

*Room at the Top* marked the beginning of Jack Clayton\'s career as an
important director. It was the third most popular film at the British
box office in 1959 (after *[Carry On Nurse](Carry_On_Nurse "wikilink")*
and *[Inn of the Sixth
Happiness](Inn_of_the_Sixth_Happiness "wikilink")*),[^8] grossing
\$700,000.[^9]

*Room at the Top* is seen as the first of the [British New
Wave](British_New_Wave "wikilink") of
[kitchen-sink-realism](Kitchen_sink_realism "wikilink") film
dramas.[^10] It was followed by a sequel in 1965 titled *[Life at the
Top](Life_at_the_Top_(film) "wikilink")*.
