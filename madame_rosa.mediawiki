'''''Madame Rosa''''' ({{lang-fr|'''La vie devant soi'''}}) is a 1977 French drama film directed by [[Moshé Mizrahi]], adapted from the 1975 novel ''[[The Life Before Us]]'' by [[Romain Gary]]. It stars [[Simone Signoret]] and Samy Ben-Youb, and tells the story of an elderly Jewish woman and former prostitute in Paris who cares for a number of children, including an adolescent Algerian boy. The film required a transformation in Signoret's appearance as Madame Rosa.

The film was viewed in context of [[Arab–Israeli conflict]]s, and received positive reviews. It won the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]], while Signoret won the [[César Award for Best Actress]] for her performance.

==Plot==
In [[Belleville, Paris|Belleville]], [[Paris]], Madame Rosa, an elderly [[History of the Jews in France|French Jew]] and [[Sh'erit ha-Pletah|Holocaust survivor]] who worked as a [[Prostitution|prostitute]], now runs a [[Boarding house|boarding home]] for the children of prostitutes. One of them is Momo, an [[Algerians in France|Algerian]] boy who is believed to be 11. Although Madame Rosa is Jewish and sometimes makes [[Anti-Arabism|racist comments]] about Momo, she raises Momo as a [[Muslims|Muslim]] in respect of his heritage, taking him to her friend Mr. Hamil for instruction in [[Islam|religion]], [[French literature]], and [[Arabic]] at the [[Grand Mosque of Paris|Grand Mosque]]. She is in fact concealing the fact that Momo is 14, expressing strong skepticism about official documents and what they can or cannot prove, and, as a result, is unable to send him to a regular [[primary school]].

Momo steals a dog from a pet shop. He later impulsively sells the dog for 500 [[French franc|francs]] and stuffs the money into the sewer. Rosa, who regards Momo as a troublemaker, takes him to her physician Dr. Katz under the belief that he is [[Syphilis|syphilitic]] or [[Mental disorder|mentally ill]]. Momo later follows her after she has a [[nightmare]] about the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] to discover her hidden Jewish space under the staircase, and the two begin to develop a closer bond. Later, after Momo dresses himself up as a prostitute and a real prostitute takes him to a cafe run by a friend of Madame Rosa's believing that he needs help, Madame Rosa makes Momo swear never to prostitute himself or become a [[Procuring (prostitution)|procurer]]. In a park, Momo meets a female [[Film editing|film editor]], and she tells him he can visit her lab any time he likes.

Madame Rosa is in exceedingly poor health and begins experiencing [[dementia]], at times having flashbacks to the [[Vel' d'Hiv Roundup|Vel d’Hiv roundup]] and falling back into the belief that she will be arrested by the [[Law enforcement in France|French Police]] and sent back to Auschwitz. Mr. Hamil also begins to have dementia, taking solace in the writings of [[Victor Hugo]]. After she has a bad fall on the stairs, Dr. Katz informs Momo that she has many health issues including [[hypertension]]. She refuses to be hospitalized. Momo believes she should be [[Euthanasia|euthanized]]. When told by Dr. Katz that euthanasia contradicts French values, Momo replies he is not French and that Algerians believe in [[self-determination]]. Momo's father, who spent time in an [[Lunatic asylum|asylum]] after murdering Momo's mother, returns to try to collect Momo, but Madame Rosa tricks him into believing that she raised him as a Jew and he suffers a fatal [[stroke]]. Momo is with Madame Rosa when she retreats to her Jewish space under the staircase to die, and is discovered with her body three weeks later. Afterwards, he goes to live with the film editor.

==Production==
[[File:Moshé Mizrahi.jpg|thumb|Israeli director [[Moshé Mizrahi]] made the film after moving to France.]]
Israeli director [[Moshé Mizrahi]] made the film after moving to France.{{sfn|Rosenfeld|2013|p=369}} While the film was based on a novel, Mizrahi was also inspired to make the film from having been raised in Egypt, Israel and Palestine.  As actress [[Simone Signoret]] said: "He's immersed in the two cultures, Arab and Jews. They're his two loves".<ref name="Sandomir">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/15/obituaries/moshe-mizrahi-dead.html?rref=collection%2Fnewseventcollection%2Fawards-season&action=click&contentCollection=movies&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=13&pgtype=collection |title=Moshe Mizrahi, 86, Who Won an Oscar for 'Madame Rosa,' Is Dead |last=Sandomir |first=Richard |date=15 August 2018 |access-date=8 December 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

===Casting===
Signoret, who starred as Madame Rosa, was initially advised by her husband [[Yves Montand]] not to take the role, and refused it for a year. Signoret explained why she was eventually persuaded to play the part, saying, "A role like that comes every 20 years. It is a cake. She is everything— liar, sincere, gourmand, poor, stupid, intelligent, warm, nasty. And she dies on top of that. If I had said 'no,' and another woman had played it, I would have been sick".<ref name="andriotakis">{{Cite web|url=http://people.com/archive/at-57-simone-signoret-decides-it-is-useless-to-hang-onto-the-branches-of-youth-vol-9-no-23/ |title=At 57, Simone Signoret Decides 'it Is Useless to Hang Onto the Branches of Youth' |last=Andriotakis |first=Pamela |date=12 June 1978 |access-date=12 October 2016 |work=[[People (magazine)|People]]}}</ref>

She had to gain significant weight for the part, with Mizrahi choosing undersized dresses with floral decorations to accentuate the weight gain.{{sfn|Hayward|2004|p=204}} Signoret was in her 50s at the time, and was made to appear 10 years older, with her wrinkles accentuated and her cheeks widened with cotton. Her legs were also padded.<ref name="andriotakis"/>

==Reception==
===Box office===
With two million viewers, ''La vie devant soi'' was a great success in France.{{sfn|Hayward|2004|p=206}} Its success may have been aided by the popularity of the TV series ''[[Madame le judge]]'', which Signoret starred in.{{sfn|Hayward|2005|p=335}}

[[James Monaco]]'s 1992 ''The Movie Guide'', reviewing the [[VHS]], gave ''Madame Rosa'' three and a half stars, stating it "handles its underlying conflicts—between Arabs and Jews, between Nazis and Jews—well, and explores its mixed racial and cultural milieu with grace, sensitivity and subtlety".{{sfn|Monaco|1992|p=510}} In 2013, Xavier Leherpeur of ''[[L'Express]]'' described Signoret as unforgettable in the film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/culture/cinema/l-immigration-dans-le-cinema-francais-un-bilan-mitige_1267376.html |title=L'immigration dans le cinéma français, un bilan mitigé |last=Leherpeur |first=Xavier |date=19 July 2013 |access-date=12 October 2016 |work=[[L'Express]]}}</ref> In his ''2015 Movie Guide'', [[Leonard Maltin]] gave it two and a half stars, describing it as "aimless".{{sfn|Maltin|2014}} ''Madame Rosa'' has an approval rating of 88% on [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 8 reviews, and an average rating of 7.4/10. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/madame_rosa/ |title=Madame Rosa (1978) |access-date=12 October 2016 |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref>

===Accolades===
''Madame Rosa'''s release, at a time when U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] was negotiating a peace between Egyptian President [[Anwar Sadat]] and Israeli Prime Minister [[Menachem Begin]], boosted its campaign at the [[50th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]],{{sfn|Hayward|2004|p=206}} where it ultimately won for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]]. While the film represented France, Mizrahi became the first Israeli director whose film won the award.<ref name="Sandomir"/> Critic [[Molly Haskell]] believed the award, "in the principle of compensation", was balanced by [[Vanessa Redgrave]] winning the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]], allowing Redgrave to make a controversial statement in favour of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]].<ref name="Haskell"/> In response to Redgrave's speech, Mizrahi commented, "Basically, she's right".{{sfn|Callahan|2014}}  In France, Signoret won the [[César Award for Best Actress]], which she had not received before.{{sfn|Lanzoni|2015|p=522}}
