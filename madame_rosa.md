***Madame Rosa*** (`{{lang-fr|'''La vie devant soi'''}}`{=mediawiki}) is
a 1977 French drama film directed by [Moshé
Mizrahi](Moshé_Mizrahi "wikilink"), adapted from the 1975 novel *[The
Life Before Us](The_Life_Before_Us "wikilink")* by [Romain
Gary](Romain_Gary "wikilink"). It stars [Simone
Signoret](Simone_Signoret "wikilink") and Samy Ben-Youb, and tells the
story of an elderly Jewish woman and former prostitute in Paris who
cares for a number of children, including an adolescent Algerian boy.
The film required a transformation in Signoret\'s appearance as Madame
Rosa.

The film was viewed in context of [Arab--Israeli
conflicts](Arab–Israeli_conflict "wikilink"), and received positive
reviews. It won the [Academy Award for Best Foreign Language
Film](Academy_Award_for_Best_Foreign_Language_Film "wikilink"), while
Signoret won the [César Award for Best
Actress](César_Award_for_Best_Actress "wikilink") for her performance.

## Plot

In [Belleville](Belleville,_Paris "wikilink"),
[Paris](Paris "wikilink"), Madame Rosa, an elderly [French
Jew](History_of_the_Jews_in_France "wikilink") and [Holocaust
survivor](Sh'erit_ha-Pletah "wikilink") who worked as a
[prostitute](Prostitution "wikilink"), now runs a [boarding
home](Boarding_house "wikilink") for the children of prostitutes. One of
them is Momo, an [Algerian](Algerians_in_France "wikilink") boy who is
believed to be 11. Although Madame Rosa is Jewish and sometimes makes
[racist comments](Anti-Arabism "wikilink") about Momo, she raises Momo
as a [Muslim](Muslims "wikilink") in respect of his heritage, taking him
to her friend Mr. Hamil for instruction in [religion](Islam "wikilink"),
[French literature](French_literature "wikilink"), and
[Arabic](Arabic "wikilink") at the [Grand
Mosque](Grand_Mosque_of_Paris "wikilink"). She is in fact concealing the
fact that Momo is 14, expressing strong skepticism about official
documents and what they can or cannot prove, and, as a result, is unable
to send him to a regular [primary school](primary_school "wikilink").

Momo steals a dog from a pet shop. He later impulsively sells the dog
for 500 [francs](French_franc "wikilink") and stuffs the money into the
sewer. Rosa, who regards Momo as a troublemaker, takes him to her
physician Dr. Katz under the belief that he is
[syphilitic](Syphilis "wikilink") or [mentally
ill](Mental_disorder "wikilink"). Momo later follows her after she has a
[nightmare](nightmare "wikilink") about the [Auschwitz concentration
camp](Auschwitz_concentration_camp "wikilink") to discover her hidden
Jewish space under the staircase, and the two begin to develop a closer
bond. Later, after Momo dresses himself up as a prostitute and a real
prostitute takes him to a cafe run by a friend of Madame Rosa\'s
believing that he needs help, Madame Rosa makes Momo swear never to
prostitute himself or become a
[procurer](Procuring_(prostitution) "wikilink"). In a park, Momo meets a
female [film editor](Film_editing "wikilink"), and she tells him he can
visit her lab any time he likes.

Madame Rosa is in exceedingly poor health and begins experiencing
[dementia](dementia "wikilink"), at times having flashbacks to the [Vel
d'Hiv roundup](Vel'_d'Hiv_Roundup "wikilink") and falling back into the
belief that she will be arrested by the [French
Police](Law_enforcement_in_France "wikilink") and sent back to
Auschwitz. Mr. Hamil also begins to have dementia, taking solace in the
writings of [Victor Hugo](Victor_Hugo "wikilink"). After she has a bad
fall on the stairs, Dr. Katz informs Momo that she has many health
issues including [hypertension](hypertension "wikilink"). She refuses to
be hospitalized. Momo believes she should be
[euthanized](Euthanasia "wikilink"). When told by Dr. Katz that
euthanasia contradicts French values, Momo replies he is not French and
that Algerians believe in
[self-determination](self-determination "wikilink"). Momo\'s father, who
spent time in an [asylum](Lunatic_asylum "wikilink") after murdering
Momo\'s mother, returns to try to collect Momo, but Madame Rosa tricks
him into believing that she raised him as a Jew and he suffers a fatal
[stroke](stroke "wikilink"). Momo is with Madame Rosa when she retreats
to her Jewish space under the staircase to die, and is discovered with
her body three weeks later. Afterwards, he goes to live with the film
editor.

## Production

![Israeli director [Moshé Mizrahi](Moshé_Mizrahi "wikilink") made the
film after moving to
France.](Moshé_Mizrahi.jpg "Israeli director Moshé Mizrahi made the film after moving to France.")
Israeli director [Moshé Mizrahi](Moshé_Mizrahi "wikilink") made the film
after moving to France.`{{sfn|Rosenfeld|2013|p=369}}`{=mediawiki} While
the film was based on a novel, Mizrahi was also inspired to make the
film from having been raised in Egypt, Israel and Palestine. As actress
[Simone Signoret](Simone_Signoret "wikilink") said: \"He\'s immersed in
the two cultures, Arab and Jews. They\'re his two loves\".[^1]

### Casting

Signoret, who starred as Madame Rosa, was initially advised by her
husband [Yves Montand](Yves_Montand "wikilink") not to take the role,
and refused it for a year. Signoret explained why she was eventually
persuaded to play the part, saying, \"A role like that comes every 20
years. It is a cake. She is everything--- liar, sincere, gourmand, poor,
stupid, intelligent, warm, nasty. And she dies on top of that. If I had
said \'no,\' and another woman had played it, I would have been
sick\".[^2]

She had to gain significant weight for the part, with Mizrahi choosing
undersized dresses with floral decorations to accentuate the weight
gain.`{{sfn|Hayward|2004|p=204}}`{=mediawiki} Signoret was in her 50s at
the time, and was made to appear 10 years older, with her wrinkles
accentuated and her cheeks widened with cotton. Her legs were also
padded.[^3]

## Reception

### Box office {#box_office}

With two million viewers, *La vie devant soi* was a great success in
France.`{{sfn|Hayward|2004|p=206}}`{=mediawiki} Its success may have
been aided by the popularity of the TV series *[Madame le
judge](Madame_le_judge "wikilink")*, which Signoret starred
in.`{{sfn|Hayward|2005|p=335}}`{=mediawiki}

The film opened on 19 March 1978 at the Plaza Theater in [New York
City](New_York_City "wikilink").[^4] It made \$5.2 million in the United
States.`{{sfn|Balio|2010|p=311}}`{=mediawiki}

### Critical reception {#critical_reception}

*Madame Rosa* met \"acclaim\" in North
America.`{{sfn|May|Bird|1982|p=38}}`{=mediawiki} [Vincent
Canby](Vincent_Canby "wikilink"), writing for *[The New York
Times](The_New_York_Times "wikilink")*, judged that [Moshé
Mizrahi](Moshé_Mizrahi "wikilink")\'s direction of the film was
beautiful, and Madame Rosa was \"a tremendous character\", Signoret\'s
\"best role in years\".[^5] [Molly Haskell](Molly_Haskell "wikilink"),
writing for *[New York](New_York_(magazine) "wikilink")*, interpreted
the story as \"a wishful fable of Israeli-Arab reconciliation\", and
said it \"managed to get to\" her.[^6] The *[Wisconsin Jewish
Chronicle](Wisconsin_Jewish_Chronicle "wikilink")* praised it as \"an
unforgettable film\", asking, \"How can a film about
[pimps](pimp "wikilink"), whores,
[transvestites](transvestite "wikilink") and average people who populate
Belleville in France be a film about love and human kindness? \...It\'s
a story of warmth and understanding between Arab and Jew\".[^7] Anna
Simons of *[The Harvard Crimson](The_Harvard_Crimson "wikilink")* stated
the film \"is carried to near perfection by Simone Signoret\'s brilliant
rendition of Madame Rosa and Samy Ben Youb\'s impressive performance as
Momo\".[^8]

[James Monaco](James_Monaco "wikilink")\'s 1992 *The Movie Guide*,
reviewing the [VHS](VHS "wikilink"), gave *Madame Rosa* three and a half
stars, stating it \"handles its underlying conflicts---between Arabs and
Jews, between Nazis and Jews---well, and explores its mixed racial and
cultural milieu with grace, sensitivity and
subtlety\".`{{sfn|Monaco|1992|p=510}}`{=mediawiki} In 2013, Xavier
Leherpeur of *[L\'Express](L'Express "wikilink")* described Signoret as
unforgettable in the film.[^9] In his *2015 Movie Guide*, [Leonard
Maltin](Leonard_Maltin "wikilink") gave it two and a half stars,
describing it as \"aimless\".`{{sfn|Maltin|2014}}`{=mediawiki} *Madame
Rosa* has an approval rating of 88% on [review
aggregator](review_aggregator "wikilink") website [Rotten
Tomatoes](Rotten_Tomatoes "wikilink"), based on 8 reviews, and an
average rating of 7.4/10. [^10]

### Accolades

*Madame Rosa*\'s release, at a time when U.S. President [Jimmy
Carter](Jimmy_Carter "wikilink") was negotiating a peace between
Egyptian President [Anwar Sadat](Anwar_Sadat "wikilink") and Israeli
Prime Minister [Menachem Begin](Menachem_Begin "wikilink"), boosted its
campaign at the [Academy
Awards](50th_Academy_Awards "wikilink"),`{{sfn|Hayward|2004|p=206}}`{=mediawiki}
where it ultimately won for [Best Foreign Language
Film](Academy_Award_for_Best_Foreign_Language_Film "wikilink"). While
the film represented France, Mizrahi became the first Israeli director
whose film won the award.[^11] Critic [Molly
Haskell](Molly_Haskell "wikilink") believed the award, \"in the
principle of compensation\", was balanced by [Vanessa
Redgrave](Vanessa_Redgrave "wikilink") winning the [Academy Award for
Best Supporting
Actress](Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actress "wikilink"), allowing
Redgrave to make a controversial statement in favour of the [Palestine
Liberation
Organization](Palestine_Liberation_Organization "wikilink").[^12] In
response to Redgrave\'s speech, Mizrahi commented, \"Basically, she\'s
right\".`{{sfn|Callahan|2014}}`{=mediawiki} In France, Signoret won the
[César Award for Best Actress](César_Award_for_Best_Actress "wikilink"),
which she had not received
before.`{{sfn|Lanzoni|2015|p=522}}`{=mediawiki}
